Chris Baird showed a way to do function calls, but to make it more efficient
I need a new ALU operation. So it's time to bite the bullet and upgrade to
16 ALU operations. I've cloned CSC version 1 to this version, version 2.
I've made the wiring change to the logisim version and csim, but I haven't
defined the new ALU operations yet. Time to scribble on paper.

We have to worry about the Asel line, so there are two banks of eight ALU
operations. Here are the ones we need to keep from CSCv1:

    Operation		Result
    --------------------------
    ALUinca		A + 1
    ALUpassb		B
    ALUpassa		A
    ALUxor		A ^ B
    ALUdadd		A + B decimal
    ALUor		A | B
    ALUand		A & B
    ALUsub		A - B binary
    ALUadd		A + B binary

I want to bring in at least:

    ALUdsub		A - B decimal
    ALUbflags		anything, but flags set to B

That leaves five more operations. I'd suggest at least these four:

    ALUmullo		A * B binary, low  4 bits
    ALUmulhi		A * B binary, high 4 bits
    ALUdiv		A / B
    ALUmod		A % B

Are there other operations that would be more useful?

Looking at the existing uses of the ALU, along with the Asel control line,
we have to at least these operations when Asel is on: ALUadd, ALUpassa
and ALUpassb. So let's try to partition up the possible operations:

  Asel off		Asel on
---------------------------------
  ALUdadd		ALUadd
  ALUdsub		ALUsub
  ALUand		ALUpassa
  ALUop			ALUpassb
  ALUxor		ALUmullo
  ALUinca		ALUmulhi
  ALUbflags		ALUdiv
  <unallocated>		ALUmod

For now, I might put in ALUzero (output is zero) as the final operation,
and temporarily implement this in cas and csim, and make sure the old
programs can be reassembled and still work. I still need to work out what
useful result we can have for ALUbflags. For now, zero.

Right, I've made the changes, and I've tested that fibminksy still runs
under the new system. That doesn't means it is perfect yet, but it's a
start. Now to start defining some new instructions. hexbench2 also still
runs, which is excellent.

I wrote a test function with four callers, and it actually worked first
time, that is so excellent! It's called firstfunction.s.

I've added some more CPU instructions that use the new ALU operations.
I've just added the extra wire from the top ROM Asel output to A12 of
the ALU ROM. This is the "bank select" control line for the two banks
of eight ALU operations.

Hmm, I noticed that fibminsky stopped working. It was my change to
the CLC control lines. I've reverted to the old set of control lines,
but I should work out why it isn't working with the new ones.
